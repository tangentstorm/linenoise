# ln.pas

This started out as a wrapper for (and then a port of) @antirez/linenoise to freepascal.
However, freepascal's standard library has pretty great terminal support already, and
much better support for strings, so it really doesn't have much to do with linenoise
after all... Except as a source of inspiration.
